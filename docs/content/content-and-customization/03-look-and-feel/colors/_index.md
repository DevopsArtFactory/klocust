title: Colors
---

By default, a site using docPort has the themeâ€™s default color.\
However, if you want your own color scheme (and you probably will!) you can very easily override the theme defaults with your own project-specific values - Hugo will look in your project files first when looking for information to build your site. 

This theme use 2 colors, named as "main" and "second" color and compute other colors from them.

You can set theses colors by editing the **site config.toml** file.

## Main color
This color is mainly used on left menu, a darker version is used for header background and content text.

{{% notice primary %}}When omited, a random value is computed on build{{%/notice%}}

```toml
	[params]
	color_main = "#B0B0B0"
```

## 2nd color
This color is mainly used for links.\
When omited, this color is computed from main color with a saturated calculation.

```toml
	[params]
	color_second = "red"
```

## Random colors

Comment theses two params in your config.toml, you will have random colors on each build... :)
