You previously mentioned that your application uses cryptography to ensure the confidentiality and/or integrity of information. That's great! But we want to make sure you're using cryptography correctly.

Note: when using cryptography, make sure algorithms are used in the right context and within appropriate constraints. For example, encrypting a session ID does not prevent an attacker from manipulating it. Similarly, a signature does not protect a message's confidentiality.

**Describe your use of cryptography (what information is encrypted/signed, how, why, what algorithms are used, etc.). Be as specific and precise as possible:**
