Because no system is entirely free of security issues, it's important to provide ways for external users to offer input and report vulnerabilities.

**Do you have an easily discoverable way for external researchers to report security vulnerabilities in your systems?**
{{<c/choices app_vuln_report_way >}}
    * (yes) Yes, we have a published security email contact, or we provide another way for users to report security issues. Incoming reports are timely reviewed and triaged.
    * (no) No, we do not currently offer a way to report security vulnerabilities for priority handling.

Make it easy for others to let you know about security issues in your products. That way you'll learn about vulnerabilities earlier and can respond to them quickly. Also, without an easy way to report issues directly to you, external researchers might publish issues widely instead.
